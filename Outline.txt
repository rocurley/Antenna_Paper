*Introduction
*Background
    *Problem we're trying to solve
        *Explanation of thermal noise problem
        *Possible applications for reducing it 
            *Radio telescopes
            *Cell phones? (I'm not sure how small this thing will be)
    *Summary of past research
        *That paper you sent me earlier
        *Others? (I don't have a good sense of how much work has been done
            along these lines).
*Theory stuff
    (One issue is that I'm not entirely sure when we moved from getting me up
        to speed into doing actual work: some of this should probably be cut
        as too basic).
    *Explain 3 coupled oscillator model
        *Justify dropping the aa and a^dagger a^dagger terms
    *Adiabatic dark state transfer? (Not sure this really was relevant, so maybe
        not).
    *Model for interaction between the enviroment and the oscillators
        (infinite serries of oscillators)
    *Effectiveness of signal transmission
    *Parameters to tweak to optimize SNR
        (There's a pretty picture I've got about halfway done of a signal
         traveling through the coupled oscillators).
*Behevior of the charged membrane
    *Effective circuit
    *Quantization? (Not sure where we are with that: Thought I had it, but
        IIRC you said it was wrong).
*Antenna
    *Explanation of choice in light of parameters we're optimizing
    *Effective circuit
*Put it all together?
    *Maybe get actual numbers for the cavity and the membrane and compute
        properties?
*Future stuff
    *Actually build one
--------------------------------------------
Most of the math is either cleaned up, or close: I don't have a good sense
of what level of detail is appropriate here.
